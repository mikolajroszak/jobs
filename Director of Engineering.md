**Snyk's mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.** The use of open source is booming, but [security is a key concern](https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/). Snyk’s product enables developers and enterprise security to continuously find & fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, with seamless integration into Dev & DevOps workflows.  
Snyk is adopted by over 200,000 developers, has multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, Heroku, New Relic, ASOS and others) and is growing rapidly.

We are looking for a full time Director of Engineering to join our engineering team either in London or in Tel Aviv.

In this role, you will lead a group of 2 to 4 teams focusing on Snyk's Container Security product development and delivery. You will be managing the team leads directly. Each team  focuses on sprint-long iterations on the main business goals driving its product. Each team has a wide set of technical competencies, enabling its independence.
Your leadership style aspires towards [servant leadership](http://toservefirst.com/definition-of-servant-leadership.html). You will enable the team leads by mentoring them in their managerial position. You will support the team members by focusing on their well-being and professional growth. You will guide the teams to deliver high quality, impactful products. You will report to the VP of Engineering.

### Responsibilities

Together with the group's Director of Product, you will guide your teams to solve the most relevant, customer oriented problems in this space.
Together with the group's Architect, you will guide your teams to provide robust and scalable solutions.

#### Enable the teams

Your main focus is grooming the team leads to make the most out of their teams, and grow as managers. You will manage the hiring and compensation on your teams, mentoring individuals to success while overseeing their well-being.
Your technical experience will allow you to be relevant to the growth of the teams, not to the individual decisions made on the teams. You will own the longer-term plan for each team's growth, balancing immediate needs with longer term success. You will foster modern delivery methodologies in your teams with a high focus on a learning organisation.

#### Execution and communication

Together with the group's Director of Product Management and Architect, you will own the business, product and technology of our Container Security product suite. Your stakeholders will include Sales, Customer Success and Marketing. Communicating high-level plans and being able to dive to the smallest customer issue is key to your success.
